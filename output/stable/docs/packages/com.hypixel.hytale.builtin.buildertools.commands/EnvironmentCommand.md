**Package:** `com.hypixel.hytale.builtin.buildertools.commands`

```java
public class EnvironmentCommand extends AbstractPlayerCommand
```

Sets the environment for the selection area by looking up an `Environment` asset by name. Validates the environment name against the asset map and provides fuzzy-match suggestions on failure.

## Command Registration

- **Name:** `environment`
- **Game Mode:** Creative

## Aliases

`setenv`, `setenvironment`

## Arguments

environment (String, required)

## Execution

All builder tool commands validate that the player is in creative mode via `PrototypePlayerBuilderToolSettings.isOkayToDoCommandsOnSelection()` before executing. Operations are queued via `BuilderToolsPlugin.addToQueue()` for sequential execution on the world thread.
